# java-battleships
It was a project made by me for Basics of programming in Java classes

You can start the game running the **Main.java** file
Battleground size and number of ships for each player can be modified in **Const.java** file 

The game is started by player placing ships on the battleground on given X and Y cooridnates
Next the computer is placing identical number of ships on random coorinates

After deployment of ships,
The player and the computer take turns to attack each other by guessing enemy ship coordinates

The game ends when either player has no more ships on the battlefield.
 
Hope you enjoy!
